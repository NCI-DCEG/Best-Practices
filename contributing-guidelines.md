# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction:
GitHub is a widely used platform for version control and collaboration in software development. It is also a valuable tool for research organizations to manage and share code, data, and documentation. The following guidelines are designed to help our organization effectively use GitHub to support our research goals.

## Guidelines:
* Repository Structure: Each project or study within our organization should have its own GitHub repository. The repository should be organized in a clear and consistent manner, with a README file explaining the purpose and contents of the repository.

* Collaboration: GitHub provides an easy way for multiple users to work on a project simultaneously. Members of our organization are encouraged to collaborate on projects and contribute to each other's work.

* Code Quality: All code in the repositories should be well-documented and adhere to best practices for code quality, such as proper use of version control, commenting, and testing. Please see [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for more guidance.

* Data Management: Sensitive or proprietary data should not be stored on GitHub. Instead, we should use alternative data storage solutions, such as secure servers or cloud storage services, and link to these resources in our repositories.

* Documentation: Documentation should be kept up-to-date and organized within each repository. This includes code documentation, project status updates, and any other relevant information.

* Commit Messages: Commit messages should be clear, concise, and descriptive, providing context for the changes made in each commit. We recommend following the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

* Issue Tracking: GitHub provides a powerful issue tracking system that allows us to track and manage bugs, feature requests, and other tasks. All members of the organization should use this system to track the progress of their work and collaborate with others.

* Pull Requests: Pull requests are an effective way to contribute code and collaborate on projects. All members of the organization are encouraged to use pull requests to suggest changes and provide feedback on each other's work.

* Projects delivering web tools/applications: the reference interactive front end is reccomended to be served through the github page mechanism (gh-pages) pointed to a branch in the same repository where the underlying code is versioned. The rationale is that the reference user-interface doubles as code testing.

* Continuous Integration: Where possible, we should set up continuous integration workflows that automate testing and deployment of code changes. This helps to ensure that our code remains stable and working as expected.

## Conclusion:
By following these guidelines, our organization can effectively use GitHub to support our research goals and collaborate effectively. By collaborating and sharing our work on GitHub, we can make our research more transparent, accessible, and reproducible.
