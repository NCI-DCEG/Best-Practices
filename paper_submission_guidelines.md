# GitHub Code Release Guidelines for Paper Submission

## Introduction:

Submitting code in conjunction with a research paper is a widely accepted practice that promotes reproducibility and transparency. With an increasing number of journals requiring code submission, the guidelines presented here aim to assist our researchers in utilizing GitHub effectively to release code versions for paper submissions.

## Guidelines:

* Tag the release: Before submitting the paper, create a tag in the repository to indicate the version of the code that was used for the paper. This tag should be in the format vX.Y.Z, where X, Y, and Z represent the major, minor, and patch version numbers, respectively.

* Include the tag in the paper: Reference the tag in the paper to provide a clear and specific reference to the code used for the paper. This makes it easier for others to access and use the code.

* Provide a detailed description: When creating the tag, provide a detailed description of the changes included in the release and any relevant information about the release. This information should be accessible from the GitHub repository.

* Create a release: Create a GitHub release for the tag to provide an easy way to download the code and view the release information.

* Keep the release up-to-date: If there are any changes to the code after the paper has been submitted, it is important to update the release information on GitHub to reflect these changes.

* Document dependencies: Make sure to document all dependencies required to run the code in the release description or a separate file within the repository.

* Code Quality: All code in the release should be well-documented and adhere to best practices for code quality, such as proper use of version control, commenting, and testing.

## Conclusion:

By following these guidelines, we can effectively use GitHub to release code versions for paper submissions. This helps to ensure that our code is accessible, reproducible, and transparent, and supports the overall goals of DCEG research.
