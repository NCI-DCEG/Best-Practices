# Bioinformatics Analysis Documentation Template

## 1. Introduction
- Briefly explain the purpose and objectives of the analysis.
- Provide the biological context and background information of  the project and the datasets.
- List any relevant references or resources used.

## 2. Data sources
- Describe the origin of the raw data (location on Biowulf, CCAD server, Cloud or open-source location) and the publication/source.
- Provide the version, format, and accession numbers of any public datasets used.
- Detail any preprocessing steps, such as quality control, normalization, or filtering applied to the data.

## 3. Software and tools
- List all software, tools, and packages used, including version numbers and download links.
- Describe the purpose of each tool used in the analysis pipeline.
- Include any relevant parameters or settings for each tool.

## 4. Workflow and analysis steps
- Provide a clear, step-by-step description of the analysis pipeline, including the input and output of each step that should allow a bioinformatician to rerun the code and reproduce the results.
- Explain any custom scripts or code used and how they were run on the servers, and provide access to them (preferably through GitHub).
- Include any quality control checks or visualizations used to assess the results at different stages.

## 5. Results and interpretation
- Summarize the main findings of the analysis.
- Provide tables, charts, or other visual representations of the results.
- Provide the location of the final results generated from running the code

## 6. Reproducibility
- List the specific steps taken to ensure the reproducibility of the analysis, such as version control, code availability, and detailed documentation of parameters.
